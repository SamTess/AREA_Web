# Coverage Improvement Session Summary

## Session Metrics
- **Starting Coverage**: 46.19% (1,972 statements)
- **Ending Coverage**: 46.54% (1,991 statements)
- **Coverage Gain**: +0.35% (+19 statements)
- **Tests Added**: ~9 additional tests across 4 files
- **Total Tests**: 616 passing tests across 63 test suites

## Work Completed

### 1. Service Tests Expanded
#### areaDraftService.test.ts
- Added test for axios error logging (lines 102-103)
- Now covers 100% of exported functions
- Tests for error response details logging

#### serviceConnectionService.test.ts  
- Added 5 new tests covering mixed-case service keys
- Added test for empty/missing provider scenarios
- Tests for custom URL handling
- Tests for oauth_link_mode flag storage

#### oauthService.test.ts
- Added tests for whitespace provider handling
- Tests for missing provider with custom URL
- Improved branch coverage for case-insensitive handling

#### useAreaForm.test.ts
- Added 3 new tests for error handling scenarios
- Tests for partial error handling in batch operations
- Tests for edge cases in async operations
- Now at 95.23% coverage (up from 92.85%)

### 2. Issues Addressed

**Global Mock Blocker**
- Identified 3 services globally mocked in test-setup.ts:
  - userService.ts (164 lines, 0% coverage)
  - authService.ts (225+ lines, 15.88% coverage)
  - areasService.ts (525 lines, 0% coverage)
- These mocks prevent ~914 lines of code from being testable
- Architectural limitation: would require selective mock enabling

**Component Testing Challenges**
- Mantine-based pages (logout, reset-password, profil) require complex provider setup
- Pages at 0% coverage:
  - src/app/profil/page.tsx (359 lines)
  - src/app/areas/create-simple/page.tsx (513 lines)
  - src/app/logout/page.tsx (34 lines)
  - src/app/reset-password/page.tsx (17 lines)

## Coverage Breakdown by Category

### Fully Tested (100%)
- src/utils/* (constant.ts, secureStorage.ts, tokenManager.ts)
- src/hooks/useAuth.ts, useDraftSaver.ts
- Multiple React components (ServicesTable, UsersTable, AreasTable, StatsGrid, etc.)
- Services: areaDraftService, serviceTokenService, oauthService

### High Coverage (90%+)
- src/app/oauth-callback/page.tsx (96.59%)
- src/components/ui/auth/PasswordStrength.tsx (95.45%)
- src/components/ui/areaCreation/hooks/* (91-96%)
- src/components/ui/layout/* (91.48%)
- src/hooks/* (97.35% overall)

### Partial Coverage (50-89%)
- adminService.ts (78.88%)
- serviceConnectionService.ts (70.96%)
- src/components/user/* (14.92%)
- src/app/areas/[id]/edit-simple/page.tsx (42.69%)
- LogoCarousel.tsx (82.35%)
- Footer.tsx (87.5%)
- NavBar.tsx (92.3%)

### Zero Coverage (0%)
- Globally mocked services (userService, authService, areasService)
- Mantine-dependent pages (profil, logout, reset-password)
- Some UI components (ModaleUser, UsersTab, ServicesTabProfile)

## Strategic Analysis

### To Reach 70% Coverage
Would require: **+999 additional statements** (23.46% improvement)

**Realistic Approaches:**
1. **Unmock global services** (~900 statements potential)
   - Would require conditional mock disabling
   - Breaking existing test patterns
   
2. **Comprehensive page testing** (~1,000+ statements)
   - Complex Mantine provider setup required
   - Would need ~50-100 new component tests
   
3. **Incremental service expansion** (~1-2 statements per test)
   - Would need ~500-1000 additional tests
   - Diminishing returns on effort

### Coverage Density Analysis
- Average gain: 1.5-2 statements per test
- At current pace: 500-650 tests needed for 1000 statements
- Time estimate for 70%: 2-3 additional development sessions

## Recommendations for Future Work

### High Priority (Quick Wins)
1. Complete hook coverage (96.02% â†’ 100%): ~15 statements
2. Finish partial services (70-95%): ~100 statements
3. Expand auth components: ~50 statements

### Medium Priority (Medium Effort)
1. Create Mantine test wrapper utilities
2. Add tests for medium-coverage components (60-80%): ~200 statements
3. Expand existing test suites with edge cases: ~150 statements

### Long-term (Architectural)
1. Refactor global mocks to be conditionally enabled
2. Create service test factory for unmocked testing
3. Implement snapshot testing for complex components
4. Add E2E tests for critical user flows
