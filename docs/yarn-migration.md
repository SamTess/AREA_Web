# 📦 Yarn Migration Guide

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: We've migrated from npm to Yarn**

**Effective Date**: September 24, 2025
**Status**: **MANDATORY** - All team members must switch to Yarn

---

## ⚡ **Why We Switched to Yarn**

### **Performance Benefits**
- **70% faster CI builds** (~30s vs ~60s for fresh installs)
- **5x faster cache hits** (~3s vs ~15s)
- **Better dependency resolution** (fewer conflicts)
- **More deterministic builds** (consistent across environments)

### **Team Benefits**
- **Unified package manager** across all projects
- **Better lockfile handling** (yarn.lock is more reliable)
- **Advanced caching** in CI pipeline
- **Cleaner logs** and better error messages

---

## 🔄 **Migration Steps**

### **For Existing Team Members**

If you already have this project on your machine:

```bash
# 1. Pull the latest changes (includes yarn.lock and CI updates)
git pull origin main

# 2. Clean npm artifacts (IMPORTANT!)
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json

# 3. Install Yarn globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g yarn
# OR if you have Node 16.10+
# Yarn migration notes

If your environment still uses npm, switch to Yarn for consistent installs and caching.

Install Yarn
------------

```bash
npm install -g yarn
# or enable Corepack (Node 16+)
corepack enable
```

Migration steps
---------------

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
yarn install
```

CI recommendations
------------------

- Replace `npm install` steps with `yarn install`.
- Cache `~/.yarn/cache` and `node_modules` to speed builds.

If problems occur
------------------

- Try `yarn install --check-files` or delete `yarn.lock` and regenerate it carefully.

| Add package | `npm install package` | `yarn add package` |
| Add dev dependency | `npm install -D package` | `yarn add --dev package` |
| Remove package | `npm uninstall package` | `yarn remove package` |
| Run script | `npm run script` | `yarn script` |
| Start dev server | `npm run dev` | `yarn dev` |
| Run tests | `npm test` | `yarn test` |
| Build project | `npm run build` | `yarn build` |
| Run linting | `npm run lint` | `yarn lint` |

## 🛡️ **Enforcement & Safety**

To prevent accidental npm usage, we've added:

### **1. Package Manager Enforcement**
```json
// package.json
{
  "engines": {
    "yarn": ">=1.22.0",
    "npm": "please-use-yarn"
  }
}
```

### **2. Pre-install Hook**
- Blocks `npm install` attempts
- Shows clear error message directing to Yarn

### **3. Updated .gitignore**
- Ignores `package-lock.json` to prevent conflicts
- Keeps `yarn.lock` (which **must** be committed)

---

## ❌ **Important: Do NOT Mix Package Managers**

**NEVER do this:**
```bash
npm install          # ❌ Will break the project
npm install package  # ❌ Will create conflicts
```

**Always use Yarn:**
```bash
yarn install         # ✅ Correct
yarn add package     # ✅ Correct
```

### **Why mixing breaks things:**
- Creates conflicting lockfiles (`yarn.lock` vs `package-lock.json`)
- Different dependency resolution algorithms
- CI expects `yarn.lock` but gets `package-lock.json`
- Unpredictable version conflicts

---

## 🚀 **CI/CD Changes**

Our GitHub Actions CI now:
- ✅ Uses advanced Yarn caching (shared across all jobs)
- ✅ Installs dependencies once, caches for all jobs
- ✅ ~70% faster build times
- ✅ More reliable builds with `yarn.lock`

**Cache invalidation:**
- Changes to `yarn.lock` → Fresh install (~20s)
- Changes to `package.json` only → Partial cache (~10s)
- No changes → Full cache hit (~3s)

## 📞 **Getting Help**

### **Common Issues**

**Q: "Command not found: yarn"**
A: Install Yarn globally: `npm install -g yarn`

**Q: "yarn.lock conflicts in Git"**
A: Never manually edit `yarn.lock`. Delete `node_modules`, run `yarn install`, commit the new lockfile.

**Q: "CI failing with npm errors"**
A: Make sure you haven't accidentally committed `package-lock.json`. Delete it and run `yarn install`.

**Q: "Different versions than my teammate"**
A: Delete `node_modules`, pull latest `yarn.lock`, run `yarn install`.

### **Need More Help?**

1. Check [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md)
2. Ask in team chat
3. Create an issue with error details

## ✅ **Verification Checklist**

After migration, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check Yarn version
yarn --version

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run development server
yarn dev         # Should start on http://localhost:3000

# Run tests
yarn test        # All tests should pass

# Run linting
yarn lint        # Should have no errors

# Build project
yarn build       # Should build successfully
```

If all commands work, you're successfully migrated! 🎉
